First a little history, Teledisk was a popular disk archival
tool around 1990.  My interest comes from the fact that there
are a number of archives, 
ie <a href="ftp://ftp.update.uu.se/pub/">Update</a> and 
<a href="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/academic/computer-science/history/">Metalab</a>, 
that contain teledisk
images of DEC RX50 disks for Rainbows, Decmates, and Pro3xxs.
You can find some discussion regarding Teledisk in <a href=
"ftp://ftp.update.uu.se/pub/pdp8/pdp-8/docs/rx50faq.doc">RX50faq.doc</a>.<p>

Teledisk was originally released as a shareware program by Sydex.
Its still available as a disk archival tool in a number of MSDOS
program archives.  The copy I found, 
<a href="ftp://ftp.update.uu.se/pub/ibmpc/util/teledisk.lzh">
version 2.12</a>, contained files dated
12/12/1990.  As near as I can tell Sydex still has a
<a href="http://www.sydex.com">web site</a> but the Teledisk
product was purchased by New Technologies, Inc in 2000. They have a 
<a href="http://www.forensics-intl.com/teledisk.html">
Teledisk</a> web page, but are not even marketing the current version,
2.22, to the general public. It is definately no longer a shareware 
program!<p>

I sent email to both Sydex and New Technologies, Inc regarding
the status of Teledisk and the archived images.  I got a 
prompt reply from Miriam W. St.Clair for Sydex, Inc.
She confirms all rights were sold to New Technologies, Inc and
further that "TeleDisk was removed by Sydex from
shareware distribution and support in April 1991".
This is consistent with the comment in the rx50faq.doc above
that teledisk V2.12 was the last shareware version and
it has been discontinued from support.<p>


Some people I have talked to still say they can use it reliably,
but my experience is that V2.12, which seems to have been used to create the RX50 
images I am interested in, does not appear to reliably recreate these images 
on current machines. One theory is that Teledisk has internal timing loops 
which depend on machine speed so it might reproduce these images on 
a vintage 1990 machine, but not on most of the systems normally 
in use today.  My original motivation was to be able to recreate disks 
from the archived images. I'm the proud owner of several IBM AT and
XT systems with 5.25" disk drives, however I have not been able
to recreate RX50 disks using Teledisk on these machines.  I'd be 
<b>fascinated</b> if anyone still has a machine running where Teledisk 
is reliable with an RX50, please describe it to me!  I'm very interested
in how it is different from the machines I've used for testing.  Note
that its only the 10 sector RX50 that causes problems, and it may be
I did not follow the formating suggestions in RX50faq.doc.
<p>


I am not interested in reverse engineering Teledisk,
I just want to extract the compressed data to a sector by sector
image of the disk with which I can work.  My personal solution
to recreating physical disks when I want them has been to use a DEC Rainbow 
to write the image back to disk using a real RX50.  John Wilson's
<a href="ftp://ftp.dbit.com/putr/">PUTR</a> is an MSDOS program
which can write RX50 images to 1.2 Mb 5.25" disk drives in
a modern PC compatible.  This is a good alternate approach if
you want RX50s.  One can also directly write sectors to 
conventional PC disks with the BIOS Int 0x13 however I have
had problems with some machines when attempting to write the
10 sector disks required for an RX50. If you need help
writing image files back to disk with MSDOS on a PC or Rainbow,
I can make a disk utility program I wrote available. See the contact 
info at the end of this document.  However I think PUTR is probably
your best bet.  If using PUTR with an RX50, mount the physical drive 
as /RX50 /FOREIGN and then use COPY /FILE/DEVICE/BINARY with the
source file created by Wteledsk to create the RX50. (see the 
examples at the end of this file)<p>

Since starting this project, I've talked to a couple people who were
interested in extracting the data from Teledisk image files to
disk image files suitable for use with one of the PDP11 emulators.
The code and algorithm presented below allow one to do this.  
The wteledsk program creates a physical disk image (sector order), 
not a logical image! (again see examples at the eof of this file)<p>

A year ago there was a significant amount of
control information in the *.td0 files that I just didn't understand.
I recently discovered that Sydex released a validation program.
This appears to be available in a number of places on the net.
There were at least two versions, you want TDCHECK V1.10 which
I found in <a href="ftp://archives.thebbs.org/archive_processors_and_doors/tdchk110.zip">
tdchk110.zip</a>.
I was able to modify key sections of some sample images and
use the tdcheck error messages to determine the function of each
region of the header data.  However I'd still
be pleased to have others review this and maybe pick up things
I've missed.  I'll try to point these areas out in the description
below.  For example most of the sample *.td0 images I found are
for 512 byte sector RX50 disks.  I did eventually find some 1024 byte
sector Akai images which allowed me to determine how the 
sector size is encoded; however these have some 'phantom' sectors that
I don't understand!  My program seems to correctly decode V2.12 images 
of DEC PRO, Rainbow and DecMate disks.  It also appears to work with V2.16 images created
for <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Studio/7012/">
Akai</a> samplers when I ignore the phantom sectors. <br>
Also of interest is a 
<a href="http://members.tripod.com/~erokhin/tdcvt.html"> Conversion
Utility</a> I found recently, unfortunately the limited documentation is not
in a language I can read.  This apparently converts teledisk images
of ZX-Spectrum game disks to an emulator format.  
I have had a brief email conversation with
the author, and he was able to put me on the right track regarding
the advanced compression algorithm.
<p>

<A name = "struct">
The algorithm below seems to work
for *.td0 images which were created with "Normal" compression.
It turns out the "New Advanced" compression just
overlays a secondary compression algorithm on top of a "normal" 
compression file.  Sergey Erokhin, the author of tdcvt, 
pointed out that the teledisk documentation says it
uses LZSS-Huffman compression.  On Sergey's recommendation I
did a search for public domain source code and found 
<a href="http://www.simtel.net/pub/pd/40094.html">lzhuf.c</a> 
which can be modified to decompress
the teledsk images.  I've included the source code and an MSDOS 
program to convert teledisk files from Advanced back to Normal 
compression.  Although Wteledsk.exe will decompress on the fly,
I only describe the Normal compression algorithm.  I'm not qualified
to <a href="http://sochi.net.ru/~maxime/doc/lzhforma.txt">explain LZSS</a> 
decompression, I just lifted the code!<p>

In the discussion below I will refer to the following
C structures from the source code, wteledsk.c:
<p>

<pre>
struct file_head {
char sig[3];  // signature "TD", nul terminated string
BYTE  unkwn,  // doesn't seem to be used?
      ver,    // for v2.11 through v2.16 seems to be 0x15
      data1,  // 0x00 (except for akai)
      type,   // see bios drive type 1-4,
      flag,   // among other things can indicate comment field
      data2,  // often 0x00
      sides;  // 0x01 (always with rx50 or 0x02 with most MSDOS disks)
WORD  crc;  //   checksum of 1st 0xA bytes in record
};
</pre>
The first three bytes are the upper case string "TD" if the
file was created using "Normal" compression and lower case
"td" if it was created using "Advanced" compression.  The next
byte is a mystery, one can change it and TDCHECK doesn't care.
As indicated above the ver field has been 0x15 in all the samples
I've found.  If one reduces this value to anywhere in the
range 0xA - 0x13 TDCHECK says the image was created with
the "Old Advanced" compression which says to me this is a
version field.  However it does not map directly to the version
numbers of the Teledisk.exe program.  Type is the bios drive
type used to create the image.  Flag appears to be a bitmap.
The low order bit(s) appear to map to the physical drive number
used when the image was created.  The high bit is set if there
is a comment block.  The data1 and data2 fields are a mystery.
Sides appears to be the upper limit for the head field.  It
is set to 1 if the disk is single sided or just side one
is checked on a two sided disk.  It is set to 2 for a two
sided disk when both sides are check and when only the 2nd
side is checked.  The last word is a 16 bit CRC, but I don't
know the formula they actually used.  It appears to be a table
driven algorithm.  Note that this initial file header always
occurs and is never encoded.  However with advanced compression
the remainder of the file is encoded.  I see nothing in the
file_head to indicate the number of tracks nor sectors per track.  
Apparently these are generated on the fly by the values in the individual 
track and sector records.  It appears that the Teledisk format allows 
a different size (as a power of 128) for each individual sector.  

<p>
<pre>
struct com_head {
WORD crc, //  checksum of 8 bytes from &len to end of record
     len;     // length of string data region following date
BYTE yr,mon,day,
     hr,min,sec; // date and time info....
};
</pre>
The structure above immediately follows the main file
header if and only if there is a comment block, ie the
high order bit is set in the flag field.  The len field
indicates the number of descriptive string bytes following
this structure.  Each of the descriptive strings is NUL
terminated.  The remaining six bytes are a time stamp, where
the year is relative to 1900.
<p>
Following this point the file loops through all the sectors
for each track alternating between heads if both sides
are being checked.  The following track_rec preceeds 
each block of track/head data:
<pre>
struct track_rec {
BYTE nsec,  // number of sectors on track
     trk,   // track number, 0 based
     head,  // head number, 0 based
     crc;
};
</pre>
A 16 bit crc is calculated for the first 3 bytes in
each track_rec.  However only the low order 8 bits are
saved for validation in the crc field.
<p>
The following sec_rec preceeds each block of sector data.
secsz has been 2 in all RX50 images (512 bytes) and 3 for Akai
(1024) byte sectors.  I believe its a power of two which
is then multiplied by 128 to get the sector size.  
Normally the sec_rec is the full 9 bytes long, however
when cntrl is 0x10 the record has a different structure
and the last 3 bytes are not included in the file.  This requires
one to read this structure in two steps. 
<pre> 
struct sec_rec {
BYTE trk,head,sec; // trk,head,sector following dat is for
BYTE secsz,        // bytes in sec = 128 * (2 ** secsz)
     cntrl,
     crc, // if there is sector data, this is low byte of crc for entire sector
          // its NOT crc of 1st 5 bytes, see DSCRC
     unknwn[2],    // please tell me if you have a guess!
     flag;         // controls extra bytes and use

}; 

I've identified three methods of filling in the sector data:
if sec_rec.flag == 0
   read the full sector directly from the file
else if (sec_rec.cntrl = 0x10)
   the sector is empty, I fill it with zeros but who knows?
   Note only 6 bytes of sec_rec were in the file in this case
else if sec_rec.flag == 1
   read next 4 bytes and treat as a rep_rec
   fill sector with rep_rec.count repeats of rep_rec.pat[]
   I believe this implies count is always half the sector size.
else if sec_rec.flag == 2
   repeat until sector buffer is full:
       read 2 bytes and treat as start of pat_rec
       flag value and count determine action.
       I call this a fragmented read as multiple
       pat_rec reads are required to fill the buffer.

struct rep_rec {
     WORD count;
     BYTE pat[2];
};

struct pat_rec {
BYTE flag,count,pat[]; //if flag > 0, repeat pat count times
};
</pre>
In a fragmented read pat_rec.flag and pat_rec.count
are always read, and they control the way additional
data is optained from the file and written to the sector
buffer.  Since the pat_rec.count is
a BYTE, the maximum value is 0xff.  As indicated below if the 
flag == 0 only the first two bytes are used and the following count bytes 
in the file are raw sector data which should be appended to the current sector buffer.  
If flag >= 1 it determines the number of bytes of pat[] to
be read from the file and copied count times to the sector buffer.
To date I've only seen flag values of 0 and 1 from Teledisk V2.12, 
however Teledisk V2.16 uses pat_rec.flag as a power of two for the number
of bytes in the pattern, ie 1 => 2 bytes, 2 => 4 bytes etc.
<p>
<pre>
The following algorithm seems to create a physical disk image,
its the logic in main() for V2.12: (ignore AKAI V2.16 stuff)
Open the output file in binary mode
Open the input file in binary mode
Read struct file_head
   Optionally validate the sig[] field.
Test file_head.flag, if high bit set there is comment data
   read the com_head
   read com_head.len bytes of descriptive strings
   optionally display this data, its not part of the output image
While not at the end of the file read struct trk_rec
   if trk_rec.nsec == 0xff  STOP  you are done
   for each sector, trk_rec.nsec, 
	process one sector per algorithm below and write to output


The following is the logic for the routine do_sector() which
is called to process each sector, one at a time.  It returns
a completely filled in sector buffer to the caller:

Read first 6 bytes of struct sec_rec, its variable length
if sec_rec.cntrl == 0x10, alternate 6 byte record
    set sec_rec,flag =1 (fudge it to a full record)
else read last 3 bytes of struct sec_rec from input
At this point I've seen 4 possibilities for the sector data:
if sec_rec.cntrl == 0x10
    there is no sector data in the file, Nul out sector buffer
else if(sec_rec.flag == 0)
    read a full sector directly from input file
else if(sec_rec.flag == 1) 
    read 4 bytes from input, treat as rep_rec
else if(sec_rec.flag == 2)  
    do a fragmented read as described above to fill sector
    buffer.  The basic algorithm for this do_read() routine 
    is shown below:
  set count of bytes in sector, sec_cnt, to 0

  BLK_SZ = 128 * (2 ** secsz)
  while sec_cnt < BLK_SZ
    read struct data_rec  
    if data_rec.flag == 0   the data's in the input file
	append data_rec.count bytes from input to sector buffer
	increment sec_cnt by # of bytes appended (max is 0xff)
    else if data_rec.flag >= 1 a byte pattern is in input file
	with length = patlen = 2 * (2 ** data_rec.flag)
	treat it as a pat_rec and read patlen bytes into pat[]
	repeat  the following data_rec.count times
            append the patlen pat[] bytes to sector buffer
	    increment sec_cnt by patlen 
</pre>

WARNING: since originally writing the section above, I extended the algorithm
to deal with some new wrinkles I found in V2.16 AKAI samples.
These are indicated in the source code, but not above.  If you
comment out the line "#define AKAI 1" near the begining of the
program it follows the logic above.  Otherwise it attempts to deal
with what seem to be phantom sectors with (sec_rec.sec & 0x60) > 0.
This frequently occurs in the V2.16 images, but it appears that
ignoring this "phantom" data works just fine.  Naturally I do not 
feel real comfortable with this solution, but it seems to work.
To decode most of the V2.16 images I have looked at one must use the "-s"
command line option to allow skipped sectors which V2.16 seems to do
fairly often.  I'm not clear if these are unreadable sectors, or
what.  This hasn't been an issue in most of the DEC images I am actually 
interested in so I have not persued the issue.

<p>

The program I wrote,<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~will_kranz/wteledsk.lzh"> wteledsk.c V1.01</a>, 
is offered as an <a href="ftp://ftp.update.uu.se/pub/ibmpc/util/lha213.exe">LHA</a> 
archive under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">
GNU General Public License</a>.  It should compile under
Linux via gcc and MSDOS with one of the Microsoft C compilers.
I encourage people to look at it and improve it.  Please give 
me some credit if you do, and more importantly let me know if 
you make it better!  The archive contains this file, the C source
code, and the MSDOS executables for creating raw images from
*.td0 wteledsk files, as well as a tdconv.exe
which converts an ADVANCED compression *.td0 file back to 
NORMAL compression.<p>

The program is conditionally compiled, and there are more conditionals
than I'd like (sorry).  It looks for MSDOS
which the Microsoft compilers define.  If defined 
an MSDOS environment is assumed, otherwise a GNU/Linux environment
is assumed with gcc.  I also have a DUMP define, when defined the
header and block dump options are enabled for debugging.
In this case the user must provide and link with their own dump()
routine, see the prototype in the source.  There is also a
DISK conditional, which should NOT be defined, which enables
absolute floppy disk routines not provided with this distribution.
The DCRC and DCOMP defines control whether CRC checks and/or
advanced compression are supported.  The supplimental source files
tdcrc.c and tdlzhuf.c are provided for those that want to turn
these options on.  Finally there is an AKAI define to enable 
V2.16 compatiblity.
<p>

<A name="example">
This version "1.01 AC" of Wteledsk was created with the conditional DUMP
and AKAI defined to enable the debug options that
I used to test the system.  Additionally DCOMP and DCRC are
defined so it handles compressed images.  You can ignore most of the usage
flags below unless you are having a problem with an image and
want to get more information, see discussion at the end of this file.<p>

<pre>
usage: wteledsk &#60filename&#62 [-o&#60outputfile&#62] [-n#] [-dh] [-db] [-s] [-r]
       -d to dump headers and/or restrutured block data
       -n limit scan to first n sectors
       -o output restructured blocks to a file
       -p display phantom sec_rec.nsec values
       -s warn instead of fatal error on skipped or repeated sectors
	  this ignores any data in repeated sectors
       -r similar to above, but write repeated sectors to disk

The input &#60filename&#62 is required
Use the -o option to generate an output file
   You can omit it for debugging, or just to test file compatibility.
   Note there is no white space between the "-o" and <outputfile>
-n limits the number of sectors processed
-dh dumps the header control blocks encountered
-db dumps the sector buffer data after it is restructured
    (the -d options are only available when conditional DUMP defined)
</pre>

<p>  
I'd be pleased to have people <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~will_kranz/contact.htm">contact</a> me
to report success or failure.  If you have problems I'm interested
cause you probably have an image I don't.  However please DO NOT just email
it to me, I've got an old slow internet connection at the end of 
a dirt road!  
<p>
Enhancements with Version 1.01 AC<br>
It now correctly handles the case where there is no comment data<br>
It displays the time stamp in the comment field (most of the
time it does this correctly but a couple files come out oddly).<br>
It now pads the sector with a fixed pattern when sec_rec.flag ==1
whereas previously it just skipped over the sector.<br>
It correctly handles the "new" ADVANCED compression.
<p>
Most of the validation done used John Wilson's 
<a href="ftp://ftp.dbit.com/putr/">PUTR</a> in one
way or another as described below.  Most source files mentioned
came from <a href="ftp://ftp.update.uu.se/pub/">Update</a>.
In general they are also available from 
<a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/academic/computer-science/history/">Sunsite</a>
in both *.td0 and logical *.dsk format.  I just noticed this, and it would
be a good validation method, but its not the one I used!
<p>
Note the rx50faq.doc at Update and Sunsite contains a fair
amount of discussion regarding interleave optimization based
on the target system.  I have NO IDEA how to control this.
It could be that this information is in the two unknwn[]
bytes in the struct sec_rec, however I can't figure it out.
One may end up with non-optimal disks using PUTR as described
below, but they boot!  What Wteledisk produces is a raw/physical
sector by sector image of the disk.  A number of the test
images from the /PRO directory at Update were for the DEC PRO series and 
are in FILES11 format.  In PUTR one can use the following mount command
where &#60file&#62 is the path/name of the output file from Wteledsk:<br>
MOUNT du0: &#60file&#62 /files11 /nointer<p>

Once mounted RSX style directory and type commands work.  Although it probably
doesn't matter, I believe PUTR determines its an RX50 from the file length.  The fact
that I can access the text files on the following reconstructed images suggests
that the images are valid:
<pre>
source file       text file viewed via PUTR's type command
f77.td0           du0:[install]install.cmd;1
decusc1.td0       du0:[userfiles]readme.txt;1 
181.td0           du0:[util]k11hlp.hlp;1

Then I dug out some bootable disks, and tried them on
an appropriate target machine.  I created an image file with
Wteledsk, then used PUTR with the following commands:
   mount b: /rx50 /foreign
   format b:
   copy /files/device/binary &#60image file&#62 b:

source of &#60image file&#62
cpm80sys.td0      tried to boot on a Decmate III, it knows its
		  supposed to be a CPM disk, but I had no CPM card.
		  Not a great test!
wpsystem.td0      booted on Decmate III
dos310b.td0       booted on a Rainbow
179-1.td0         booted on a PRO 350  (PRO disk maintainence diskette)
vnx2xfer.td0      booted on a PRO 350  (Venix install disk from Venix2.zip)

The results above suggest I have a fairly robust decoder.  All the samples
above decode without the -s or -r options.  There are 80 sequential 
tracks each with 10 sequential sectors in the images.  There is also a 
wps?.td0 collection for the PRO at update.  Like the Venix2 distribution 
these are in the ADVANCED compression format, but they all contain skipped 
and/or repeated sectors.  I suspect this means that when they were created 
the source machine was having a hard time reading the target disks and 
tried more than once on several of the tracks.  When my code detects a 
skipped sector it inserts a test message in the image file, 
   "Skip %2d blocks".
Even with the -r option which allows it to overwrite with repeated
sectors these images end up 20 - 30 skipped blocks out of the total 800.

I do not understand what wps1.td0 is supposed to be, probably an empty
disk.  wps6.td0 is in DECVMSEXCHNG format and I have no good way
to validate it.  The others can be mounted and read using PUTR, but
casual examination of some of the text files reveals several have
holes in them where a block was skipped.  Using the -r options helps,
but does not eliminate the problem for script.com.  
My guess is these are not usable images, but it could indicate a 
problem with Wteledsk.

source file       text file viewed via PUTR's type command
wps2.td0          du0:[001054]script.com;1
wps3.td0          du0:[zzsys]sir.msg;1
                  du0:[zzsys]setup.msg;1
wps4.td0          du0:[zzsys]futl.hlp;1

wps5.td0 has a different problem.  The second trk_rec read is 
#1 which is expected, but then the next sec_rec is for track #2
rather than track #1.  Never seen an image like this, and my code

In closing I give a sample header dump using the "-dh" command
line option from blank.td0.  This was posted on the vmsnet.pdp-11
newsgroup by Kevin McQuiggin on 02/07/1999 as a sample of a blank
RX50 formated for a PDP11.  I present an abridged version of
the initial screen output resulting form "wteledsk blank.td0 -dh":

........ this repeats through all tracks with 10 sectors
per track.  Note tracks are zero based and sectors are
one based in this format.  The 7th and 8th bytes in the 
sec_rec are unknwn[]  = {05 00} for all sectors.  This 
makes me think it has nothing to do with the hardware
sector ids, but what do I know!

If an output image is produced from blank.td0 its just
a 409,600 byte file where each byte has the value 0xE5.
